.RB [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The Ur\(hyQuan Masters is a 2D inter\(hygalatic adventure game.
You return to Earth with a vessel built from technology discovered from an
ancient race called the Precursors only to find it enslaved. Gather allies
from a wide variety of races, engage in space combat with various foes, and
save the galaxy from the Ur\(hyQuan!
.SH OPTIONS
Valid command line options:
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Display a help message.
.TP
.B \-r, \-\-res \fIresolution\fR
Sets the screen resolution.  Unless \-\-opengl is set, the only valid
values are 640x480 and 320x240.
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-fullscreen
Uses full screen mode.  Pretty straightforward.  Usually good to
combine with \-r 320x240. 
.TP
.B \-o, \-\-opengl
Use OpenGL drivers.  This produces higher-quality graphics, and may be
faster as well \(hy\(hy but it also may not work on older cards.
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-scale=\fImode\fR
Graphics scaling mode (linear, biadapt, biadv, triscan, hq). Default is none.
Try these to get smoother graphics with cost on performance.
.TP
.B \-b, \-\-meleezoom=\fImode\fR
Melee scaling mode (step, aka pc, or smooth, aka 3do). Default is 3do.
Slower machine owners can set it to nearest to get better performance
in melee but degraded visual quality.
.TP
.B \-s, \-\-scanlines
Simulates interlaced displays.
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-fps
Print fps information in the status window.
.TP
.B \-g, \-\-gamma \fIvalue\fR
Sets gamma correction. 1.0 causes no change (unless your graphics card
is originally set to a different value). Higher than 1.0 makes the
image brighter, lower than 1.0 makes it darker.
.TP
.B \-C. \-\-configdir \fIdirectory\fR
Set the directory where the game will seek its configuration files.
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-contentdir \fIdirectory\fR
Set the directory where the game will seek its data.
.TP
.B \-M, \-\-musicvol \fIvolume\fR
Set music volume (0\(hy100).
.TP
.B \-S, \-\-sfxvol \fIvolume\fR
Set sound effects volume (0\(hy100).
.TP
.B \-T, \-\-speechvol \fIvolume\fR
Set speech volume (0\(hy100). If set to 0, game runs in 'no speech' mode and
oscilloscope reacts to the music.
.TP
.B \-q, \-\-audioquality high | medium | low
Specifies how nice the audio sounds. Slower machines should lower
the audio quality.
.TP
.B \-u, \-\-nosubtitles
Disables subtitles.
.TP
.B \-l, \-\-logfile \fIfile\fR
Sends console output to a logfile.
.TP
.B \-\-addon \fIaddon\fR
Replace \fIaddon\fR by the name of an addon to enable in the game. May be
specified multiple times.
.TP
.B \-\-sound openal | mixsdl | none
Specifies which driver/mixer to use. Default is mixsdl. 
openal is only available when it has been  compiled in.
It may produce higher\(hyquality sound and will probably be faster,
but it is not very stable on linux platforms, and may not work
well with some sound cards.
Use "none" as a last resort if you cannot get other drivers to work,
or if you have no soundcard.
.TP
.B \-\-stereosfx
Enables positional sound effects in melee. Currently works only when
using openal.
.TP
.B \-\-nethostN \fIhostname\fR
Server to connect to for player N (1=bottom, 2=top)
.TP
.B \-\-netportN \fIport\fR
port to connect to/listen on for player N (1=bottom, 2=top)
The default port is 21837.
.TP
.B \-\-netdelay \fIframes\fR
Number of frames to buffer/delay network input for.
.TP
.B \-m, \-\-music 3do | pc
Controls use of the 3DO remixed soundtrack for songs that were in fact remixed.
3DO is the default.
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-intro 3do | pc
Controls the intro/ending version. 3DO is the default.
.TP
.B \-\-cscan pc | 3do
Use either PC (text) or 3DO (pictograms) style planet information when scanning.
The default is PC.
.TP
.B \-\-menu pc | 3do
Use either PC style (text and 'CREW'/'BATT') or 3DO (pictograms) in melee.
The default is PC.
.TP
.B \-\-font pc | 3do
Use either PC or 3DO style fonts and colors. The default is PC.
.TP
.B \-\-shield pc | 3do
Use either PC style (static) or 3DO style (throbbing) slave shield. The
default is PC.
.TP
.B \-\-scroll pc | 3do
Scroll voice\(hyover/subtitles 1 page at a time (PC style) or smoothly (3DO
style) when using left/right arrow keys. The default is PC.
